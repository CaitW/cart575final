			<description><![CDATA[The Kirkland hotel was considered more rustic compared to the deluxe Cliff House, located on the North shore. A pavilion came before the hotel in 1876. This was a place for people to cook, eat, and dance. The two-story hotel replaced it in 1889. 
Kirk’s wife sold the property to the state around 1911 and it was leased by two other proprietors until 1927. It was still used to shelter groups throughout the 30’s and 40’s. In 1946, the state tore it down. It was the last hotel to be removed from the park.

			<description><![CDATA[Ringling brothers, Charles and Henry, leased land on the south shore in 1915. On this property they called Sandy Beach, they built a summer bungalow, cottages, an ice house, and a building for their car and chauffeur. These buildings are long gone and only the foundation for the house and bungalow remain.

Today: Stone foundations are still visible.

In 1873, it was enlarged to house 200 guests and renamed Cliff House. In 1884, the Annex was built so 400 visitors could stay and enjoy a plush vacation at Devil’s Lake.

			<description><![CDATA[Palisade Park was the brainchild of Arthur Ziemer. During a geology class field trip to Devil’s Lake in 1893,  he envisioned creating a resort area similar to the Catskills in New York State. In the summer of 1894, he acquired 90 acres on the west bluff and plotted the area for over 200 lots, a hotel, and a road. An 85 foot tower was constructed near the Ziemer’s cottage.  
Palisade Park was never completed. Fate intervened when Ziemer died in October, 1895 of typhoid fever from drinking water from a nearby spring. As word of his death spread, no one wanted to live in what was to be "the most prominent resort in the northwest.”

Today: Stone stairs & tower foundation are still visible.

By 1910 there were 31 cottages and 41 private parcels of land on the south shore of Devil's Lake. The Messengers sold to the State in 1911, as the Park was being established. the first park manager and his wife lived in the hotel for a few years. The UW Summer Survey Camp moved from Kirkland, on the southeast shore to Messenger Shore and stayed from 1920 through 1956. They occupied tents and cabins on concrete slabs. Most were removed for construction of the nearby parking area, but a few remain near the cache area.]]></description>

The camp was located on the Messenger family’s property. The Messenger family ran a local hotel on the southwest shore until 1911.

			<description><![CDATA[William H. Canfield was a civil engineer and the first county surveyor; in the late 1800's. Later in life, Canfield started the “Old Settlers Association” (OSA). Around 1903, he bought 3 acres of land near Messenger shore and built a cabin, treehouse, and assembly hall. 

The property proved to be too small and the OSA never became popular. After Canfield's death in 1913 the land changed hands several times before the park acquired the it in 1943. Today, the only sign of the OSA is the circular foundation of the tree house.

In January 1940, several high school students went down the run when it was closed and were thrown when they hit a snowdrift, killing one girl. Run was closed about a year later.
