					"body": "Devil’s Lake has experienced a long and rich modern history dating back to the mid 1800’s. European settlers and immigrants first came to the lake via railroad which was completed in 1873. A hotel ‘boom’ created by the increase in tourism resulted in several hotels located on the south shore, with one hotel located to the north. These hotels included amenities such as a telegraph office, billiard room, barber shop, grocery store, bowling alley, and a zoo. Leading into the 1900’s with the expansion in quartzite mining, the Civilian Conservation Corps (C.C.C.) put about 200 young men to work from 1934 to 1941 to combat the Depression Era. They build things like the Park Headquarters, the Rock Elm Shelter, and the Ranger Headquarters. Their work efforts can still be seen today as they also built trails, removed invasive species, relocated roads, and built a reservoir. "

					"body": "Devil’s Lake is home to almost 100 bird species that nest within the park. Also, about 880 plant species grow in the park. Four state natural areas are a part of Devil’s Lake and include Parfrey’s Glen, South Bluff/Devil’s Nose, East Bluff, and Devil’s Lake Oak Forest. Parfrey’s Glen is a moist, moss-covered gorge home to a large range of flora including yellow birch, mountain maple, and red elder as well as many rare plants, including the federally threatened northern monkshood and the state-threatened round stemmed false foxglove. Two state-threatened birds inhabit the area, including the cerulean warbler and the Acadian flycatcher. Insect fauna include rare species of diving beetle and caddisfly. South Bluff/Devil’s Nose natural area is a mesic and dry-mesic forest consisting of sugar maple, red oak, white oak, basswood, and hickories. Many rare plant species inhabit the area including drooping sedge and nodding pogonia. Rare birds include cerulean warblers, Acadian flycatchers, and arrowhead spiketails. The East Bluff natural area consists of open talus (rock) slopes, dry prairie, open oak woodland, and closed canopy southern hardwood forest. This diverse area supports rare plants such as drooping sedge and slender bush-clover. The Devil’s Lake Oak Forest is a southern drymesic forest with numerous red oak and red maple. Rare birds include the Acadian flycatcher, Kentucky warbler, and the hooded warbler. "

					"body": "The first people to step foot near the lake dates back more than 10,000 years ago. There is prehistoric evidence of people using areas within a day’s walk of Devil’s Lake after the latest ice age. Mound building is the clearest evidence of Native Americans, with mound building dating back 1,000 years. Effigy, linear, and conical mounds were built, as Native Americans frequented the lake, but did not show any signs of inhabitation on a long-term basis. Unfortunately, a lot of the mounds were destroyed in the process of European settlement through the creation of tourism, house building, and farming. "

					"title": "Geology",
					"body": "About 1.6 billion years ago, the Devil’s Lake Bluffs were formed as part of the Baraboo Range. Rock was formed via sand deposits from ancient rivers flowing from shallow seas about a billion years ago. This initially created sedimentary sandstone, which formed into metamorphic quartzite through extensive time, heat, and pressure. After the retreat of the seas, the quartzite buckled upward and formed the North Range and the South Range as well as gorge areas like Parfrey’s Glen. The seas then reentered the area, bringing new sediments and covering the bluffs in sandy and limey deposits. Again, the seas retreated and took much of the sediment along with it, exposing the bluffs. This subjected the exposed bluffs to continuous freeze and thaw cycles, creating current day formations like Devil’s Doorway and the massive piles of rocks that can be seen on the sides of the bluffs. Finally, the ice age of about 15,000 years ago formed the Wisconsin Glacier. This glacier covered the eastern half of the Baraboo hills, but not the western half. Due to this, we can see the boundary of the glacier which formed a terminal moraine formed of rocks and gravel. The glacier redirected these ancient rivers and formed two dams, creating Devil’s Lake, which is essentially an abandoned valley that used to be part of an ancient river."

					"title": "Fishing",
					"body": "Devil’s Lake is approximately 374 acres large with a mean depth of 30 feet and a max depth of 47 feet. Fishing is quite common as the DNR stocks Brown Trout and Walleye. Easy access fishing is possible from the Lake’s sidewalk trails as well as from a boat using the two boat launches. One important note is that no power boats are allow, so this is a great lake for small boats, canoes, or kayaks. Devil’s Lake is mesotrophic and has moderately clear water, some underwater rock structure, and a range of weed species. Fish often seen in the lake include: Panfish (abundant), Largemouth Bass (Common), Northern Pike (Common), Smallmouth Bass (Common), Trout (Present), and Walleye (Present. A full species list is available at http://www.devilslakewisconsin.com/fishing-devils-lake/. "
